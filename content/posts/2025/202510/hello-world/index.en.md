Hi, I'm frxiaobei.

This is my first post after officially setting up my blog.

Not to port content, nor to "own a territory," but to preserve the real thinking logic behind those fragmented expressions.

### Who Am I?

Someone who has been revolving around AI, products, and creation systems for a long time.
I've done product architecture and design expression; written code and proposals; managed projects and teams.

In recent years, I've increasingly realized a fact:

> Technological leaps don't necessarily bring structural evolution. What's truly valuable is the **reconstruction of behavior, organization, and expression methods** after capability changes.

This is also why I started writing this blog.

### Why Blog? Isn't X Enough?

I also write on X, but the pace there is too fast.
Many things I want to explain systematically, or keep for my own future reference, aren't quite suitable for threads.

Some content isn't urgent to post, but worth writing clearly.
Some judgments can't be explained in one sentence.
And some expressions are essentially written for myself.

So I started this blog, to write things out properly.

### What Will I Write?

Simply put, three types of content:

#### 1. **Expression Systems & Creative Practice**
How do I use AI to assist creation?
How to build a structured expression process?
Agent tools + knowledge backtracking + multi-platform collaboration—how do these combine into a "contextual expression network" in a personal system?

#### 2. **Management & Products**
In recent years doing products and leading teams, I've realized that organizational tension and rhythm are the core variables affecting outcomes.
When AI capabilities are in place, they actually expose many management problems, collaboration method problems, and feedback mechanism problems.

I'll write about:
- What in management cannot be replaced by tools
- How AI participates in decision-making, processes, and structural adjustments
- The actual challenges of moving from "boss micromanaging everything" to "AI-native self-organization"

#### 3. **Industry Judgments & System Evolution**
From large models, agents, creation tools, healthcare scenarios, to new business models—I'll write about the structural changes I see, critical points, and how builders should respond.

I don't chase hot topics, but I judge critical points.

This blog has no fixed frequency, but will be continuously updated.

I hope it will eventually be:
- An expression replica that can be repeatedly retrieved
- The construction process of a thinking system
- Also a builder's reserved ground
