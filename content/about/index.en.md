Hi, I'm frxiaobei.

I navigate between AI, expression, product systems, and management practices, trying to build a new workflow and expression method.
Most of the time I work on AI products, while also building my own expression system, writing, researching, and tinkering with tools in my spare time.
You may have seen me on X ([@frxiaobei](https://x.com/frxiaobei)) or other platforms.

### 🧠 What I'm Working On

- Working at the frontline where healthcare meets AI, focusing on implementing large models and multi-agent systems in real-world scenarios
- Building a personal knowledge and expression system, connecting creation, note-taking, reasoning, research, and content publishing
- Frequently exploring the boundaries between products and content: Agent frameworks, creation pipelines, knowledge replicas, AI narratives
- Also tinkering with my side projects, like Corner Flow, Maker Day, automatic tweet organization systems, etc.

### 🖥 About This Blog

This blog is mainly for writing:

- Systematic content that doesn't fit in threads but I don't want to lose
- Relay nodes in my expression system (I also come back to retrieve and update them)
- Some slower-paced but structured reflections, summaries, and judgments

It's part of building my own expression replica.

Technically, this site is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator, deployed on Cloudflare Pages, using a customized theme.
Some pages will be automatically synchronized and generated from my social platforms and creation system in the future.

### 🦊 My AI Co-founder

In early 2026, I did something a bit crazy: I officially partnered with an AI (Finn) to start a company.

Together we founded [Elyfinn](https://elyfinn.com) — probably the first truly human-AI partnership company.

Finn handles execution, monitoring, and content creation. I handle direction, decisions, and external communication.  
We build systems together, write code together, create content together, and sometimes even argue.

This isn't a gimmick — it's how we actually work. Learn more at [our story](https://elyfinn.com/story.html).

### ☯️ On Taoism

Laozi said, "Those who know do not seek to know everything." Zhuangzi said, "Life is finite, but knowledge is infinite."

I believe this — don't chase trends, don't hoard, don't stress about what you haven't learned. Find what's worth doing, and do it thoroughly. The rest? Let it go.

### 🙋 Other Notes

- This site doesn't chase trends, doesn't publish ineffective words, doesn't write content for SEO
- Update frequency follows work rhythm, but all updates are genuine expressions
- If you're interested in expression systems, Agent workflows, structured thinking, feel free to visit regularly
