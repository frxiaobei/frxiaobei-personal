# Elyfinn Theme Plan

## Summary
- Applied Elyfinn brand palette via CSS variables and mapped them to PaperMod surfaces for light/dark modes.
- Updated typography to use Inter + Source Han Sans SC (with sensible CJK fallbacks).
- Added brand header styling and replaced the site logo with the Elyfinn fox.
- Designed card-style post list entries with hover accent bar.
- Tuned code block/inline code styling to match the brand.
- Built a branded footer section with logo, links, and tagline.

## Files Touched
- `assets/css/extended/custom.css`: Brand variables, typography, header/footer styling, card styles, code blocks, and responsive tweaks.
- `layouts/partials/extend_head.html`: Load brand fonts.
- `layouts/partials/extend_footer.html`: Branded footer markup.
- `hugo.toml`: Updated label text + logo.
- `static/images/elyfinn-fox.png`: Added Elyfinn fox logo asset.
