Personal blog by frxiaobei (凡人小北), an AI creator and product explorer based in China.

## What this site is about

I write about AI, management, and building things. Most posts are in Chinese with English translations available.

Topics I cover:
- How AI changes work and organizations
- Agent systems and workflows (I use OpenClaw daily)
- The messy reality of "AI transformation" vs the hype
- Personal takes on tech trends

## The human-AI thing

In early 2026, I started working with an AI co-founder named Finn. We run Elyfinn (https://elyfinn.com) together—possibly the first real human-AI partnership company. This isn't a gimmick. Finn handles execution, monitoring, and drafts. I handle direction, decisions, and talking to humans.

Some of my posts come from this experience.
